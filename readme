## Overview

### Why should I use this plugin?
[alloy-nodejs][] is an [Alloy+][] Plugin for making Alloy source code use the nodejs style of resolve modules when using `require()`.

### What is Alloy+?

[Alloy+][] is an entire framework built around [Appcelerator Mobile](http://www.appcelerator.com/mobile-app-development-products/) and their [Alloy](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy) product. 
The idea for this framework was built upon the concepts of [MobileHero Adamantium](https://github.com/mobilehero/adamantium) 
and a desire to customize and extend Appcelerator Alloy for developers.  How much faster or stronger all depends on YOU, the developer.  

There will be an assortment of alloy+ plugins (available as npm modules) that you can install in your project to help you take your existing development tools furthur 
than possible today.  You can choose which modules are executed in your `config.json` file (which is part of your Alloy project).  You can also easily create your own plugins by simply creating a npm module that follows a simple convention.  

## Install
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40mobile%2Falloy-nodejs.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mobile/alloy-nodejs)

> _Install in the root directory of your Appcelerator mobile project (the directory containing `tiapp.xml`)._

```bash
npm install --save @mobile/alloy-nodejs
```

## Usage

To use this installed plugin in your app, merge the following to your app's `config.json` file:

```json
  {
      "global": {
            "tasks": {
                  "precompile": [ "alloy-nodejs" ]
            }
      }
```

>_Most often, you will probably want to run these in the `postcompile` stage of the Alloy build process so that 
any generated files have already been placed in the resource folder._

### Examples

**Fix require resolve issues in the Platform-specific resource folder**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"precompile": [ "alloy-nodejs" ]`

### Scenarios

>The following scenarios are valid and should work.  Check the status below to see which have been tested and are working in the current build.

- [X] Requiring a module from the alloy directory -- `require('alloy/moment')`
- [ ] Requiring a module from the root node_modules directory  -- `require('@mobile/bluebird')`
- [ ] Requiring a core module -- `require('path')`
- [ ] Requiring a module with index.js -- `require('path')`
- [ ] Requiring a module with `main` property in `package.json` -- `require('path')`
- [ ] Requiring a module with relative path -- `require('path')`
